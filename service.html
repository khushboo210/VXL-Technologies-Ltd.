 <h1>Communications System Modelling</h1><br>
 <p>Telecommunications abound with block diagrams. Generally
they are small sub-systems of a larger system. Their behaviour is
described by the author with the help of mathematical equations, and
with drawings or photographs of the signal waveforms expected to be
present.<br>
Most early experiments are concerned with illustrating a small part of a
larger system. Two or more of these sub-systems can be combined to
build up a larger system.<br>
The list of possible experiments is limitless. Each instructor will have his
or her own favourite collection - some of them are sure to be found
herein.<br>
Naturally, for a full appreciation of the phenomena being investigated,
there is no limit to the depth of mathematical analysis that can be
undertaken. But most experiments can be performed successfully with
little or no mathematical support. It is up to the instructor to decide the
level of understanding that is required.</p>

 <h1>Embedded Development</h1><br>
 <p>Electronic Concepts and Engineering has an experienced team of Design Engineers 
 each with 15 to 33 years applicable experience. Our programs range from individual 
 tasks to clean sheet designs which require hardware and software development, 
 qualification testing, and system integration support.<br>
 ECE offers a full range of design services for embedded system development that 
 include system architecture and design, electronic circuit design & analysis, 
 real-time software design, GUI and tool development, printed circuit board design, 
 mechanical packaging design, and documentation.<br>
 Our core competencies include microprocessor/microcontroller embedded 
 system development, specifically for rugged applications.<br> 
 Upfront efforts are made to design for EMI and Environmental effects. 
 We have developed systems utilizing microprocessors and microcontrollers 
 from Freescale, Infineon, Intel, Texas Instruments, Microchip, 
 as well as others. </p>

 <h1>Hardware Platform Development</h1><br>
 <p>A hardware platform is a set of compatible hardware on which software 
 applications can be run. Each specific hardware platform has its own machine language, 
 and programs must be built specifically for a platform that involves a standardized 
 type of processor and associated hardware pieces.<br>
 In some cases, operating systems might be classified as hardware platforms. 
 Technically, operating systems are their own software programs that must be
 built for a hardware platform. For example, IBM PC hardware is designed 
 to run certian operating systems, while the Apple hardware platform runs others.<br>
 IT professionals may refer to newer devices like smartphones and tablets 
 as having their own individual hardware platforms. With the rise of cloud hosting 
 and Web-delivered services, the word platform has also been used to refer to 
 free-floating, or multiplatform, software platforms that use the Internet rather 
 than a specific hardware platform to connect with individual machines or work stations.<br></p>

 <h1>Application Development and Maintanence Services</h1><br>
 <p>Software enables business organizations to develop, manage and exploit information for profit.  
 Typically, business organizations use a combination of commercial, off-the-shelf 
 software and proprietary software.  To deal with changes in hardware platforms, 
 software operating systems and commercial and regulatory requirements, all software needs ongoing changes.  
 The software may become a SAAS (software as a service) product and possibly be integrated into the cloud.  
 The developed software is created in order to meet the needs of the enterprise.<br>
 In outsourcing, application development and maintenance means the process of managing the design, 
 coding, testing and ongoing improvements and debugging of software. Business organizations that use 
 proprietary software may use internal resources subject matter experts and process 
 managers to prepare and update the overall business requirements definitions for new software.  
 Then they can outsource the coding, testing and implementation of new BRD on a work-for-hire basis.<br>
